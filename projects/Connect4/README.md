The folder that I received this project in was made for Netbeans, and the libraries just wouldn't work properly for IntelliJ.
I decompiled the libraries using IntelliJ's decompiler, where I got TeacherAgent, and 
my friend got TeacherAgent2 using [jd-gui](https://github.com/java-decompiler/jd-gui).
My own agent is MyAgent.java.

I recommend using Netbeans for the project. This code here is incomplete, and is meant to only be used as a reference.
