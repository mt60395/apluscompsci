# Notes
I was tearing my hair out until I realized that I needed to use setPreferredSize.

All of this code was done by myself, with a little help to know I was on the right track.
I chose to do this with GeneralPath. You can also draw individual squares/ovals and add them when the mouse is clicked/dragged.

I took some time to make the layout look decent, hence the magic numbers for some Dimensions.
# Extra things I added
This is probably not required:
- The clearing functionality
- Scrolling through brush sizes
# TODO
Some other things you can do include:
- File saving
